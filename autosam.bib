It provides historical background to the domain, before gong on to describe the open and decentralised characteristics which have partially characterised its development. This is done principally through the lens of Pelagios, a collaborative initiative led by the authors which connects online historical resources based on common references to places. The benefits and limitations of the approach are evaluated, in particular its low barrier to entry, open architecture and restricted scope. The paper concludes with a number of suggestion for encouraging the adoption of Linked Open Data within other humanities communities and beyond.},

	abstract = {Chronology in Archaeology contains many hidden assumptions. Chronological intervals resulting from data analysis are sometimes based on absolute “certain” datings (e.g. C14 or Roman emperor reign years) or derived from relative datings or combinations of these. This may even lead to circular argumentations with hidden contradictions. To produce verifiable chronological relations, a well documented data scheme containing all the relevant chronological archaeological information is required.We modeled this scheme as an RDF (Resource Description Framework) based ontology comprising Allen`s interval algebra and provided the results as Linked Open Data. This is exemplarily done by parsing CSV based datasets of two case studies, one concerning the Iron Age settlement history of the Central African rainforest, and the second focusing on a system for Roman period classification used at the RGZM in Mainz.The first case study was based on a recently finished PhD thesis and reviewed the current knowledge on the settlement history of the Central African rainforest. The available data derived from surveys and excavations between present-day Cameroon and Angola. Chronological relations between groups have been modeled within a RDF graph in order to produce a machine readable and processable semantic representation. Additionally, we used radiocarbon dates from the OpenAccess data repository Archives des datations radiocarbone d'Afrique centrale (aDRAC). For the second case study, we developed a workflow for the RGZM retrieval system “easydb” in which a wide variety of time interval descriptions is used. Apart from the historically definable Roman emperor reigning years, which can often be subdivided by the consulship years of an emperor, many descriptives such as “early Roman” or “late Roman/early Medieval” are regularly used but far from being precise. For both case studies using RDF based modeling generated a reproducible representation of the state of knowledge concerning the temporal sequences of time intervals.},

	abstract = {The African Red Slip Ware (ARS) is a central archaeological object type for the understanding of late antique world of ideas, their exchange and socio-economic history. The 3-year project ARS3D, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), started in February 2018 and aims to document, digitise and publish the relief-decorated ARS, located in the Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum (RGZM). The ARS3D project will publish the facts and archaeological interpretations of these ARS objects. In this process the ARSs are 3D scanned and processed to create their 3D surrogates. These 3D models support archaeological interpretations which should be documented. Here we present our ontology that forms the structural fundament for the documentation and the underlying triplestore as data repository. The axioms are primarily based on CIDOC-CRM with few additions to fulfil our requirements. In addition, we included axioms to provide structure for storing meta- and para- information generated during the creation of 3D models. We have also included axioms from PROV-O, the W3C compliance ontology for structuring the provenance information of the 3D generation process. An interactive web application provides the graphical user interface of this ARS data repository. In this paper we consider data quality aspects for: 1) Provenance quality that affects the archaeological interpretations. 2) Archaeological factual quality on ARSs such as iconographical descriptions by bibliographic references and external resources, e.g. Icon Class to access the LOD cloud. 3) Identifying the provenance and storing chronological information.},

	abstract = {Since the mid-1990s the RGZM (Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz) provides web-based databases containing millions of datasets with content from many different archaeological disciplines. These relational databases were constructed in interdisciplinary transnational projects and include a lot of “hidden archaeological assumptions”. The aim of our paper is to make these hidden assumptions visible and provide them as a Linked Open Data graph to establish reproducible research as a basis for Open Science.

In particular the Samian Research database [1] at the RGZM which is based on the Names on Terra Sigillata project of Leeds and Reading Universities funded by the AHRC offers nearly 250'000 identified potter stamps, which are traditionally dated in a traditional way. In Roman archaeology this is usually expressed by establishing "absolute dates" in well known “from-to” tables, whereas in reality, the situation is much more diffuse. In fact, Samian dating is quite often based upon so-called ‘dated sites’, which are themselves dated by Samian. Occurrences of South Gaulish Samian on “historically dated sites” like Hadrian’s Wall with its absolute dating or the Wetteraulimes with its less clear dating are difficult to use as dating arguments because it is not possible to say a priori whether these were “survivals” or whether they were part of a still existing South Gaulish export industry. Therefore an RDF (Resource Description Framework) based model has been developed to deal with occurrences making the Samian dating process verifiable and transparent.

This paper focuses on modelling dating arguments using a relative chronology based on Allen’s interval algebra [2] compared with absolute dates in the prototypical build Academic Meta Tool [2] to create Linked Open Data for reproducible and transparent research. This tool enables the creation of an RDF-based ontology such as for modelling dating arguments and visualising the semantic reasoning for detecting errors.

	abstract = {The Linked Data Cloud is full of controlled resources, which in fact quickly run out of control. Firstly, each resource collection, e.g. a thesaurus, is cooking its own soup related to its research context. Secondly, conceptualisation of LOD assumes standardised data, but in reality, only generic concepts or real instances exist. Thirdly, archaeological items are usually related to generic instances in the LOD cloud, based on their object orientated nature. Describing these relations by modelling archaeological assumptions causes ambiguities which have to be tamed to guarantee data quality for reuse, demonstrated in three examples:

(1) Trying to link a triangular “lateen sail” into the LOD cloud, a problem known from the NAVIS II ancient ship depictions database, reveals that each repository has completely different “hidden assumptions” in its hierarchies with respect to their scientific domain. Are the usually SKOS based relations able to solve the challenge to model also the degree of doubt? Are different methods required?

(2) Trying to map pot fragments of Gaulish Terra Sigillata to historically defined concepts of “types” and “service families”, or aligning these typologies, ends up in modelling doubtful assumptions. Can metrics be used to define “type” definitions? How can an already existing online research community help?

(3) Setting up a meta-index for aligning various distributed databases at the RGZM by keywords and linking into the LOD Cloud is subject to uncertainties within the modelling of relations. As a result, this process includes dealing with the above mentioned ambiguity challenges.},
